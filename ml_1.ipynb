    "Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and models for computers to learn and make predictions without explicit programming. It involves constructing mathematical models that analyze data, identify patterns, and improve performance over time. Machine learning algorithms can adapt and adjust based on input, allowing them to handle new situations. They are trained using labeled or unlabeled data and can be applied to various domains like image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems."
